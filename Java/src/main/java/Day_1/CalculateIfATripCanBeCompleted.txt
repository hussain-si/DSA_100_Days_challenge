Hint;

Input format
The input consists of 3 double values denoting - petrol left, average kilometers per litre of petrol and distance from petrol pump, in that order.

Output format
Return true if you can make it to the petrol pump in time, else return false.


Sample Input 1
3 50 100

Sample Output 1
true

Explanation 1
Number of kilometres that can be covered = 3*50 = 150 kms.
This is more than the 100 km distance from the petrol pump. So, the answer is true.


Sample Input 2
1 25 50

Sample Output 2
false

Explanation 2
Number of kilometres that can be covered = 1*25 = 25 kms.
This is less than the 50 km distance from the petrol pump. So, the answer is false
