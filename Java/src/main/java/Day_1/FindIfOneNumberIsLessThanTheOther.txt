Problem Description
You need to create a static method named isLessThan(),
which will take two integer values as input and return true if the
first integer is less than the second. Else, it returns false.


Hint: Note that the method is completely missing.
It needs to be created by you. Refer to the previous problems,
if needed, to understand how to do this.

Hint: The return type has to be a boolean.


Sample Input 1
1, 9

Sample Output 1
true

Explanation 1
1 is less than 9, so true
